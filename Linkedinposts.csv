"This is what happens when energy policy prioritizes ideology over reliability: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) warns blackout risk could rise 100x by 2030 as states retire sources like gas and nuclear without adequate replacement. Even without retirements, outage risk could rise 30x because planned supply isn’t enough to match rising demand.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act mandates 100% renewables by 2045, and Virginia can’t afford the risks of renewable tunnel vision. Virginia will continue to invest in reliable baseload sources like nuclear and natural gas, alongside renewables and innovative technologies, as part of an all-of-the-above strategy to keep the power on and our communities safe.
